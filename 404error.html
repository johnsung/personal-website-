      <p>MORE ABOUT ME <br>
        <br>
         I am from Los Angeles, California. I am a Lakers fan (LABron came to Lakers!) and love Korean food. I like to hang out
       with my friends, play guitar, and do outdoor activities.

   I started my academic as a Chemical Engineer in UC Davis, but my interest in Computer Science grew as I took classes that required
 coding. I am interested in Engineering, Software, and Cybersecurity. Here's my downloadable resume</p>
